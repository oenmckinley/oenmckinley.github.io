# About Me

Hello! My name is Oen McKinley, and I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate with the [Visual Interface and Behavior Exploration Lab](http://visualdata.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. My focus is in the field of Data Visualizations, working with [Dr. Alvitta Ottley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yepPD_cAAAAJ&amp;hl=en).

# My Research

My research has so far focused on the realm of trust in Data Visualization, namely whether and how the design elements of a visualization impact the viewer's trust, accounting for the demographic characteristics of the user.
