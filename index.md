# About Me

Hello! My name is Oen McKinley, and I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate with the Visual Interface and Behavior Exploration Lab at Washington University in St. Louis. My focus is in the field of Data Visualizations, working with Alvitta Ottley.

# My Research

My research has so far focused on the realm of trust in Data Visualizations, namely whether and how the design elements of a visualization impacts the viewer's trust, accounting for the demographic characteristics of the user.
