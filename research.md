# My Research

## My Focus

My research is in the field of Data Visualizations, with a particular focus on the realm of trust in Data Visualizations. Specifically, I have been researching whether and how the design elements of a visualization impact the viewer's trust, accounting for the demographic characteristics of the user. 

Recently, I have also been interested in Design Guidelines. This includes what makes a visualization confusing or unclear, determining the perception of users, and solutions to help improve visualization designs. 

## VIBE Lab

The [Visual Interface and Behavior Exploration (VIBE) Lab](http://visualdata.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis uses interdisciplinary approaches to study visual interfaces, explore human behavior in decision-making processes, and advance the understanding of how people interact with visualizations. The lab is led by [Dr. Alvitta Ottley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yepPD_cAAAAJ&amp;hl=en).
