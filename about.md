# About Me

## History and Experience

### Overview

Hello! My name is Oen McKinley, and I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate with the [Visual Interface and Behavior Exploration Lab](http://visualdata.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. My focus is in the field of Data Visualizations, working with [Dr. Alvitta Ottley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yepPD_cAAAAJ&amp;hl=en).

I grew up in Northfield, Minnesota for most of my childhood before going to Grinnell College in Iowa. I then moved to Omaha, Nebraska with my now wife. After moving to Des Moines, we now find ourselves in St. Louis, Missouri for my Ph.D. research at Washington University. 

### Work and Education History

I received a Bachelor of Arts from Grinnell College for Computer Science and Political Science in 2015. After graduation, I worked as a Software Engineer for three years with a Bay Area start-up on developing their employee benefit software solution. 

### Current Ph.D. 

After three years of software engineering, I decided to make a career change into research. I had always been interested in the human side of computer science, and after my rotations I have been working with Alvitta Ottley's Visual Interface and Behavior Exploration Lab at Washington University, focusing on the field of Data Visualization.
